# Scraping Library

A python based project to scrape web-sites.
This is a personal project to explore web scraping and better understand how it works.
I also made this project a library, mostly to practice packaging and publishing a python library.
If you have any suggestions or issues, please open an issue.

## Installation

This project was built with
[Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)
but requires
[Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)
or higher. 

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Facundo-Barbera/Scrapper.git
```
